# Guitar Note String Test

This is a simple app that will randomly flash notes of a guitar for you. 

Currently in standard chromatic tuning. You can change the strings (line 3 of script.js) and notes (line 7-12).
Each note currently shows for 8 seconds, you can alter this on line 63 if you're a speed demon.
